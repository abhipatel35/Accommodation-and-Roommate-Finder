# Accommodation and Roommate Finder - UI/UX Design

## Overview

This project focuses on designing a user-centered platform that integrates apartment searches and roommate matching. It aims to streamline the process of finding accommodation and compatible roommates with an emphasis on usability and accessibility.

Key contributions include:

- **User-Centered Design**: Developed detailed user personas and user journeys to inform the interface and features of the platform.
- **Wireframes and Prototypes**: Created low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes to visualize and test the platform's design.
- **Information Architecture**: Structured the platformâ€™s navigation and content to ensure easy access to apartment listings, roommate profiles, and communication tools.
- **Interactive Elements**: Designed chat forums and private messaging systems for seamless communication between potential roommates.
- **Usability Testing**: Conducted usability tests with target users to iterate and refine the design, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the platform is fully responsive and optimized for various devices, enhancing accessibility for all users.

## Files Included

- **Prototype A.fig**: Low-fidelity prototype showcasing the initial layout and wireframe designs.
